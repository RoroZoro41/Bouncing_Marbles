✅ add sound effect (marble sound) for ball clanging (and wall touching)

✅ teleport the balls to inside the window if they get pushed out

✅ Add moving shader as background

✅ make the balls teleport to exactly the boundaries when outside of them

✅ add ball shader

Make the size of the ball be determined by how much the player moves the mouse
while holding left click

fix bug that makes the sound play over and over again annoyingly

BONUS:

add an area around the right clicked mouse, and if there is a ball inside it, 
dragging = true
make sure that only one ball is selectable

✅ drag + click to delete a ball?

Allow warping, if ball touches right side, teleport to left
