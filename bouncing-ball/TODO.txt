✅ add sound effect (marble sound) for ball clanging (and wall touching)

✅ teleport the balls to inside the window if they get pushed out

✅ Add moving shader as background

✅ make the balls teleport to exactly the boundaries when outside of them

✅ add ball shader

✅ Make the size of the ball be determined by how much the player drags mouse

✅ make it so that when a ball is created, it doesn't spaz out when in a wall

✅ make it so that the balls can't be *too* big

✅ make it so that you gotta drag alot to make a ball 
(like double the drag for half the ball)

✅ make it so the noise only happens the moment the balls collide, and never during
or give ball bounciness so that it doesn't span noises when stuck

✅ fix bug that makes the sound play over and over again annoyingly
Set a max limit to the nb of sfx playing at the same time 
(not necessary if balls stop being fucking stupid)

✅ Make a teeeeny reset button at the top middle

Fix bugs:

❌	ball spawns in top left corner when u press both buttons
✅	if you hold left click, drag a tiny bit, the hold right click,
		then the ball outline doesn't disapear
❌	Pressing the reset button activates the circle outline, turn that off

BONUS:

❌ Touch support
	1 finger for drag,and reset button
	drag + touch with 2nd finger to delete
	2 finger for create (not 1:1, make the ball smaller than the distance between fingiess)

❗❗❗ CURRENTLY DOING ❗❗❗
Fix the shaders being streched

add an area around the right clicked mouse, and if there is a ball inside it, 
dragging = true
make sure that only one ball is selectable

Allow warping, if ball touches right side, teleport to left

✅ drag + click to delete a ball?
